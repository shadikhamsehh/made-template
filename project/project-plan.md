# Project Plan

## Title
Analyzing the Impact of Wave Energy Farms and Urban Air Quality on Climate Dynamics

## Main Question

How does the implementation of wave energy technology impact urban air quality, and what predictive models can be developed to forecast these effects on climate dynamics in urban settings?

## Description

This project aims to analyze the correlation between renewable energy sources, specifically wave energy farms, and changes in urban air quality. Utilizing data from the Large-scale Wave Energy Farm and Beijing Multi-Site Air Quality datasets, this study will explore how shifts towards renewable energy in coastal regions could potentially affect urban air pollution levels.

The ultimate objective is to develop predictive models that forecast air quality changes resulting from increased adoption of wave energy technology.


## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1:  Large-scale Wave Energy Farm
* Metadata URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/882/large-scale+wave+energy+farm
* Data URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/882/large-scale+wave+energy+farm.zip
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset encompasses data on configurations and energy outputs of wave energy converters at different scales and environmental conditions. It includes details such as the arrangement of converters, the power output of individual units, and the total power output of farms, essential for understanding and modeling the efficiency and environmental impact of wave energy farms.


### Datasource2: Beijing Multi-Site Air Quality Data
* Metadata URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/501/beijing+multi+site+air+quality+data
* Data URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/501/beijing+multi+site+air+quality+data.zip
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset records hourly measurements of various air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3 from multiple monitoring stations across Beijing. Additionally, it includes meteorological data such as temperature and humidity, offering a comprehensive view of the factors influencing urban air quality.
