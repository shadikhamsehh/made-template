## Title
Analyzing the Impact of Air Quality Measures on Climate Dynamics in Urban Settings

## Main Question

How do variations in air pollutant levels across different urban environments correlate with climate change indicators, and what predictive models can be developed to forecast these effects on urban air quality?

## Description

This project aims to analyze the correlation between urban air quality measures and climate change indicators using datasets from Beijing and various European locations. By integrating data from the Beijing Multi-Site Air Quality and the European Air Quality dataset, the study will explore how different environmental policies and geographic conditions influence urban air pollution levels.

The ultimate objective is to develop predictive models that forecast air quality changes in urban settings based on historical data, helping to inform and guide environmental policies and urban planning strategies.


## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Beijing Multi-Site Air Quality Data
* Metadata URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/501/beijing+multi+site+air+quality+data
* Data URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/501/beijing+multi+site+air+quality+data.zip
* Data Type: CSV insde ZIP file

This dataset records hourly measurements of various air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3 from multiple monitoring stations across Beijing. Additionally, it includes meteorological data such as temperature and humidity, offering a comprehensive view of the factors influencing urban air quality.


### Datasource2:  European Air Quality Dataset
* Metadata URL: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/jrc-abcis-ig-2017?locale=en
* Data URL: https://jeodpp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ftp/jrc-opendata/ABCIS/InorganicGases/Ver2017-01-01/InorganicGases_2017.csv
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset includes air quality measurements from various European locations, providing data on pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3, collected over a similar timeline as the Beijing dataset. It offers a comparative perspective on urban air quality across different regulatory and environmental contexts.
