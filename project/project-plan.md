# Project Plan

## Title
Relationship Between Agricultural Practices and Methane Emissions.

## Main Question

How do specific agricultural practices impact methane emissions globally, and what are the projected implications of these emissions on achieving the 1.5 °C climate stabilization target under different mitigation scenarios?

## Description

This project explores the connection between agricultural practices and methane emissions, significant contributors to global climate change. By examining various farming methods and their impact on methane output, the study aims to assess the potential of different mitigation strategies to meet the 1.5 °C climate stabilization target.

The findings will offer valuable insights for policymakers and agricultural stakeholders, guiding the development of strategies that effectively reduce methane emissions and align with global climate goals. Ultimately, the study seeks to bridge the gap between agricultural practices and environmental impact, promoting sustainable farming that supports both agricultural productivity and climate health.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Agricultural non-CO2 emission reduction potential in the context of the 1.5 °C target
* Metadata URL: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/5a06cad1-6c12-4d17-b008-4b58956ec3d8?locale=en
* Data URL: https://datam.jrc.ec.europa.eu/datam/perm/od/dfe58f9f-0609-4cac-a139-efff80eecf83
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset examines the role of agricultural practices in global methane and nitrous oxide emissions, which constitute approximately 10-12% of all anthropogenic GHG emissions. It focuses on the potential impacts of these emissions on meeting the 1.5 °C climate stabilization target, exploring the effectiveness of emission reduction technologies and changes in farming practices. Key findings indicate significant potential for emission reductions through advancements in livestock management and combined dietary shifts, aiming for substantial decreases in GHGs by 2050.

### Datasource2: EDGAR v6.0 Greenhouse Gas Emissions
* Metadata URL: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/edgar-v6-0-greenhouse-gas-emissions?locale=en
* Data URL: https://jeodpp.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ftp/jrc-opendata/EDGAR/datasets/v60_GHG
* Data Type: Excel XLS

EDGAR v6.0 catalogues emissions of major greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, and F-gases) across different sectors and countries. It details both fossil and biogenic CO2 sources but excludes emissions from large-scale biomass burning and LULUCF activities. The dataset incorporates comprehensive activity data updated to 2018, including energy balances from the IEA and agricultural data from the FAO, enhanced with recent global industry statistics. Notable updates include refined CO2 emission factors for coal mining and new shipping emissions profiles.


### Datasource3: Methane’s contribution to agricultural emissions and climate change
* Metadata URL: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/65a20d8d-f110-40a4-8548-7b44e4d4e1bb?locale=en
* Data URL: https://datam.jrc.ec.europa.eu/datam/perm/dataset/e9e38173-95b8-4bce-a3e6-fcf21edcd191
* Data Type: CSV

Owing to its short atmospheric life, methane’s contribution to agricultural emissions and climate change may vary substantially depending on the temporal scale considered. Based on projections from three agricultural economic models, this study reveals how different appreciations of methane’s global warming potential may affect the cost-effectiveness of carbon pricing and low-meat diets.
